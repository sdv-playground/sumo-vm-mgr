//! Host-side transport implementations + re-export of the contract.
//!
//! The trait surface (`DeviceChannel`, `StreamChannel`, `DeviceTransport`,
//! `SharedMemory`, `Doorbell`, `TransportError`, `seqcount_write`) lives in
//! the [`vm_wire`] contract crate so host and guest never duplicate it.
//! This module re-exports those names so existing host callers
//! (`use vm_devices::transport::DeviceChannel;`) continue to work.
//!
//! Two layers, same as before:
//!
//! - **Low-level** `SharedMemory` + `Doorbell`: byte-level shmem ops + notify.
//!   Used by shmem-backed transport impls. Tied to "this is a memory region"
//!   semantics.
//!
//! - **High-level** `DeviceChannel` + `DeviceTransport`: substrate-agnostic
//!   "structured-state-with-notification" primitive. Devices consume this so
//!   the same device code runs over shmem (`IvshmemTransport`,
//!   `QvmShmemTransport`) and network (`HttpTransport`) without changes.
//!
//! See `tasks/device-transport-design.md` for the full design.
