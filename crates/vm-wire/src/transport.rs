//! Transport contract — traits + error type.
//!
//! Two layers:
//!
//! - **Low-level** [`SharedMemory`] + [`Doorbell`]: byte-level shmem ops + notify.
//!   Used by shmem-backed transport impls. Tied to "this is a memory region"
//!   semantics.
//!
//! - **High-level** [`DeviceChannel`] + [`DeviceTransport`]: substrate-agnostic
//!   "structured-state-with-notification" primitive. Devices consume this so
//!   the same device code runs over shmem (`IvshmemTransport`,
//!   `QvmShmemTransport`) and network (`HttpTransport`) without changes.
